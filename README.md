Exam Case   -   Sea   ForestSeaweed   can   change   the   world   –   that’s   what   Sea   Forest   founder   and   CEO      Sam   Elsom    believes   .    In   fact,    after   running   a   successful   clothing   label   for   a   number   of   years   ,   Sam    packed   it   all   in   to   grow   seaweed,   which   is   the   main   operation   at   Sea   Forest.
Why is Sea Forest   growing   seaweed?The   seaweed   cultivated   by   Sea   Forest   is   called   Asparagopsis   .   It   is   a   red   seaweed   native   to Australian   Coastal waters   .   Sea   Forest   is   the   first   to   cultivate   this   seaweed   at a commercial scale through both marine and land-based   aquaculture.The      main      incentive   for   growing   Asparagopsis    is    its    effectiveness    in    reducing    the   production of methane   (a   greenhouse gas)   in   ruminant   livestock   ,   including   cattle   and   sheep.    It      is      claimed      by      Sea      Forest      that      “animals      whose      diets      contain      0.2%    Sea Forest’s      [Asparagopsis]    supplement      will      have      methane      reductions         up      to      98%”   ,   according   to   a   recent   scientific   publication”   .   This   could   drastically   impact   the   effects   of climate change.
What   is Sea Forest’s Current   Focus?In   the   early   days   ,   Sam   focused   on   perfecting   his   product.   However,   the   business   is   now   starting   its   “   rapid   growth”      phase.      Because   of   this   ,   Sam    is    focusing   on   three   things:
1. Growing as   much Asparagopsis   as   possible,
2. Developing   a   network   of farmers   that will   pay   to   use   its   supplement   product,   and
3. Growing awareness   of the benefits   of Sea   Forest’s Asparagopsis   supplement   amongst   major   meat   purchasers   including supermarkets   and   restaurants   , so   that   they   may   preferentially   purchase   product   that   has   been   fed   Sea   Forest   Asparagopsis   supplements   .
What does Sea   Forest   Need?To   do   this   ,   Sam   knows   that   he   needs   Business   Intelligence   on   every   aspect   of   his   business   ,   from   the   growth   rates   of   Asparagopsis    in   different   environments   ,   to   the   preferences   of potential primary   and secondary   customers   ,   including livestock farms   and the customers who purchase from those farms   .


1       The   three   objectives   in   the   current   focus   of   Sea   Forest,   as   stated   in   the   exam   case, were   based   on   Business   Intelligence that   informs   the company   about what their   potential customers   (livestock   farm   operators   , restaurants   , and consumers) want.
Such   Business   Intelligence   were   obtained   by   careful   analysis   of various   data   collected   from   Sea   Forest’s   business transactions   and market research efforts   .
a.   In   one   sentence,      based   on   the   context   of   the   exam    case,   suggest   what    Sea    Forest’s   Business      Intelligence   may   have   informed   them   about   what   its   potential   customers   want,   which   results      in   Sea   Forest’s   current   operations   .   (Hint:   For   example,   LUSH   operates      in   their      current      mode      because      their      Business       Intelligence      suggest      that      their      potential   customers   are “committed to ethical buying and are   obsessed with   the   purity   of   handmade   items   ”.) (2   marks)
b.   For      the      Business       Intelligence      suggested      in      your      answer      to      part      a,      suggest      TWO   transactions      where   Sea      Forest    may    have    obtained   the      relevant   data   to   generate   such   information. Also state   what relevant data were obtained in EACH transaction.   (8   marks)
c   .   For   EACH   of the   two   transactions   suggested   in your   answer   to   part   b,   suggest   a   relevant   specific   TPS   that   can   be   used   to   process   the   transaction   or   capture   the   relevant   data.   Describe how such data is   captured with a specific   made-up example.   (5   marks)

2       As   SeaForest’s   network   for farmer   customers   grows   ,   the   company   sets   up   a   relational   database   to   replace the   existing   spreadsheet   record   of the farmer’s   information   and the   sales   transactions   .   This   change allows   Sea   Forest to address the emerging issues   about their   “Quality   of   Data”   as   the   amount of data grows   .
In   class   , you   were   introduced   to   6 dimensions   of   the   Quality   of   Data:
a. Suggest   TWO   such   potential   Quality   of   Data   dimensions   that   are   likely   to   be   violated   by   using      a      spreadsheet      to         manage      a         large      amount      of      transactional      data.      Justify         your suggestions   with   a   brief   explanation   and   a   specific   example.   Note   that   your   suggestions   must be related to the nature of spreadsheets for this   specific   purpose.   (9   marks)
b.   For   each   of   the   two   violations   given   in   your   answer   to   part   a,   explain   how   the   use   of   a   relational      database      instead      of      a      spreadsheet      can      avoid      such      violations   .    Support      each explanation   with   a   specific    example   of   relational   database   design   (eg.    How   the   data   is   organised   to   minimise   the   specific   violation).   Note   that   your   answer   must   be   about   how   relational   databases   may   address   the   short-comings   of   spreadsheets   for   managing   large   amounts   of   data,   rather   than   the   properties   of   relational   databases   that   are   not   related   to   such short-comings   .

b.   Recommend   the      most   suitable   type   of   Collaboration   system    covered      in   this    course   to   facilitate   such   form   of   collaboration.   Explain   the   reason   for   your   recommendation.   Further   justify   your   recommendation   with   an   explanation   about   why   the   other   three   types   are   not   suitable. (8   marks)
c   . A   junior      staff      at      Sea      Forest      suggested      that      an      Enterprise      System      (such      as      the      one   described      in   the      Red      Sneaker      example      covered      in      class)    is      good      for      facilitating   such collaboration. Given the three   potential risks   of Enterprise   Systems   covered   in   this   course,   discuss why this   is   not a good suggestion.   (5   marks)

4            In      order      to         incentivise         large         meat         purchasers         and         end         users         to         purchase         SeaForest’s   supplements   ,   Sam   is   developing   a   transparent   way   for   all   participants   in   the   supply   chain   to   see   the   methane   reductions   they’re   supporting.   By      providing   QR   codes   for   farmers   and   packers   to   include   in   their   documentation   and   packing,   everyone   can   trace   back   to   the   methane   reduction   impacts   of   the   meat   they’re   purchasing.   They’ll   also   be   able   to   see   a   live   tracker   of   the   overall   methane reduction that SeaForest has   made.
Provide four ways that SeaForest can use this   information to increase their sales   .   (8   marks)

5         Sam   has   decided to take this   idea   one step   further   by   allowing   end   user   customers   to   keep   track   of the amount of methane they   have saved   over   time   by   recording   their   purchasing   history.   Users   will   be able to create an account   by   entering their   name   and   location.   The   system   will   then   be   able   to show   live leaderboards   of methane savings   in each location.
a.   Provide   two   security   issues   and   one   ethical   issue which   could   result   from   the   information   provided   in   this   question. (3   marks)

6         Sam   has   decided   to   implement   the   live   tracking   analysis   of   methane   reduction   and   has   hired   a   technology   consulting   team   to   implement   the   systems   needed   to   create   this   .   In   order   to   go   live,   the consulting team   will need to create a system   that   tracks   the   number   of   livestock   that   are   being   given   SeaForest   supplements   ,   the   amount   of   methane   reduced   through   their   lifespan,   and   the   breakdown of that   methane   reduction when the animal   is   prepared   into   it’s   various   cuts   .   It will also   need   to   be   able   to   allow   for   end   users      to   create   their   accounts    and   track    their   own   methane   reduction scores   .
Sam   has   worked out a   budget for this   project and   hopes   to   have   it   completed within   six   months   to   align with their planned   marketing campaign.The   technology   consultants    have   found   it   more   difficult   than   expected   to   create   a   system   that   tracks   the   meat   all   the   way   to   the   end   user,   and   have   communicated   that   the   project   will   take   longer than expected.

7            Nine      months      after      going      live      with      the      project,    Sam      has      been      contacted      by      an      eco-terrorism organisation   explaining   that   they   have   been   able   to   breach   SeaForest’s   systems   and   obtain   a   list   of   all   of   the   farmers   that   use   their   products   as   well   as   the   amount   of   methane   they’ve   reduced.   They   have   threatened   to   use   that   information   to   target   other   farmers   who   do   not   use   SeaForest   supplements with targetted protests   and   disruptions   .
Provide   a   critical   analysis   of the   four   risk   management   responses   available   to   Sam   along   with   a   recommendation.

Recommendation:


8         Sam   is   looking to   increase efficiencies   in the   process   of growing Asparagopsis   .   One   of the   things   that results   in higher costs   is the fact that   SeaForest   needs   to   employ   people to   regularly   check   on   the Asparagopsis to understand water temperature, mineral content and growth   rates   .
a.   Provide   a   recommendation   for   how   Sam      could   use   the   Internet   of   Things   to   make   this   process   more   efficient.    (5 marks)
